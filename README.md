# foc
Hyper realistic two-channel sim racing seatbelt tensioner with two 48V 54+54A FOC motors and controller that blows commercial 1300$ solutions out of the water

Specifically, it is high torque low latency that comes with its own software with support for real dynamic frequency effects for haptic feedback

### PLEASE see [JOURNAL.md](JOURNAL.md)

### Why?
- HackClub's great initiative [highway](https://highway.hackclub.com): not just "free money" but a nice community of beginners and advanced that help each other
- Lack of respect for realism in sim racing: All too often "immersion" devices are just smoke and mirrors to generate profit, lacking careful design for realism, and the community defends this.
- Vastly overpriced consumer solutions: Really? 1300$ for something that can be surpassed by a consumer with 350$?
- Fun but complex to build toy: Using the rig is fun, but building stuff for it is better
